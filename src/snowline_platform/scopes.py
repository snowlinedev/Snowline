"""The scope service — the platform-owned operations over the `Scope` tree.

Carried (functionality-first, NOT imported) from the frozen monolith's
`snowline_server.graph`: `get_scope`, `ancestor_scopes_until_isolated`,
`scope_tree`, `list_scopes`, plus the bare-slug⇔org invariant + slug-derived
`parent_id` from `update_scope`. The platform owns scopes (architecture.md §2);
this is the read/resolve + create surface the HTTP API and MCP tools wrap.

`resolve` is NON-MUTATING (spec §3 "auto-vivify"): the monolith's
`resolve_or_stub` convenience is intentionally NOT carried into the public read
path — creation is explicit via `create`.

**Replication (spec §8, issue #81):** the platform dogfoods the same SDK
emit/ingest modules it offers plugins — `create`/`update` emit
`scope.created`/`scope.updated` in the SAME transaction as the domain write
(the transactional outbox, §3), and `apply_scope_event` is the domain APPLY
function an opted-in stream runs deliveries through (`replication.py` wires it
into the SDK's ingest route). Both directions reuse `create`/`update` rather
than a separate write path, so their EXISTING exceptions are the ordering/
collision error taxonomy §8 needs — see `apply_scope_event`'s docstring.

        idempotent replay), so this apply re-raises it as the SDK's `ParkNow`
        (#92): the event parks on THIS delivery with no retry budget spent.
        Parking already IS spec §8's "fail loud, manual resolution" — first-
        class state (tool/UI/health signal, never a log line) that stays
        re-appliable once an operator renames or retires the losing scope and
        calls `reapply_parked` — and a `ParkNow` park is bit-for-bit that same
        state, it only skips the pointless backoff budget before the
        inevitable park (the friction #92 filed from this exact call site).
      * `ScopeNotFoundError` (the parent slug hasn't replicated yet) — an
        ordering gap, not a permanent failure (spec §8's ordering note): it
        stays on the DEFAULT bounded-retryable path (NOT `ParkNow`) and
        self-heals the moment the parent's own `scope.created` applies, so
        ordinary scope-stream lag never drops data. This is precisely the
        transient case the retry bound exists for.

    present locally is a no-op — covers `reapply_parked` replay and any
    future re-delivery ambiguity, even though the SDK's watermark already
