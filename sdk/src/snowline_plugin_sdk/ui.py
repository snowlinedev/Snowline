"""UI contract constants + kind-shape documentation (ui-shell.md §3/§4).

These are a deliberate COPY of the platform's source of truth
(`snowline_platform.manifest`: `UI_CONTRACT_VERSION`, `UI_WIDGET_KINDS`,
`UI_PAGE_KINDS`, `UI_KINDS`). The SDK is the published, light dependency
EXTERNAL plugins install (contract.py's docstring explains why it stays
stdlib-only — no pydantic, no platform import at runtime): a plugin author
building a `ui` manifest block or a `/ui-api` response reads these constants
+ shape docs instead of reverse-engineering the shell's renderer. A
drift-guard test (`tests/test_ui_contract_drift.py` in the platform repo, a
dev-only import of this SDK — mirroring `governance/tests/test_contract_drift.py`)
pins this copy EQUAL to the platform's so the two can never silently fork.

Unlike `contract.py`'s `CONTRACT_VERSION` (which gates a hard
accept/reject check), `UI_CONTRACT_VERSION` here is documentation only: per
spec §3, an unfamiliar `contract_version` on a manifest's `ui` block — and an
unfamiliar `kind` — REGISTER fine and fail visible at render (§4.4), so this
module intentionally ships no `check_ui_contract_version`-style gate. Kind
shapes below are illustrative dicts/docstrings, not schemas — nothing here
validates a plugin's actual `/ui-api` response at runtime; that is the shell's
job, and a malformed one renders the §4.4 error card.

Pure constants — no imports beyond stdlib.

# declares the button label, the write endpoint, and the form fields, and the
# shell handles rendering, submission, and — on a 2xx — following an optional
# plugin-relative `navigate` href in the response.
#
# Registration-time validation (platform `manifest.py`/`UIAction`): 422 if
# `endpoint` doesn't start with '/ui-api/', if it references a '{param}' absent
# from the page's `route`, on any unknown action or field key, or on a
# duplicate action id / field name within the page. `kind` on a field stays a
